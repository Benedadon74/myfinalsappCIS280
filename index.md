# Welcome to Bernard's Finals App Webpage.


### Description of App:

This is an inventory tracking app. This app will show the number of each individual item that is available. You can set a number so that you can be reminded to order more of that particular item so that you do not run out. It is great for merchandisers such as clothing salesperson, parts dealer etc.
